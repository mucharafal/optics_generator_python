Hello,

Before you start editing:

Common problems- compilation. When you use different environments than me (fedora 31),
 you probably have to change standard of c++ in makefile. Checked- on LXPLUS it is C++ 11,
 SWAN needs C++ 17. Your local system? I don't know.

Adding files:
schema of adding files is presented in Makefile. Add file to first rootcint invoke, compile .o and later add rootcint
and gcc invokes.

What 'make shared' produce?
.pcm files which are needed by ROOT to read in serialized class objects.
library .so in the same aim.

Where are also dependencies?
File interface/FitCingLinkDef.h - here is list of classes used to generate FitCint.cc file.

So two important files during compilation process:
interface/FitCingLinkDef.h
src/Makefile

Good luck!
